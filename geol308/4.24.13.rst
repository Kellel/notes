Earthquake frequencies
----------------------

- 1000s - 50Hz
- Each quake is combination of many frequencies
- The bigger the quake the lower the frequencies
- What you record may not be what the quake started with

Attenuation
-----------

- Waves move through Earth
- Friction created with each oscillation
- Energy lost due to friction

Seismometry
-----------

- Seismometer
	sensor that responds to ground motion
- Seismoscope
	records ground motion without measuring time


The first known seismoscope was in China 132 B.C.E.
