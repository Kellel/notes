Coseismic Events
================

Tsunamis
--------

- Earthquakes
- Landslides
- Volcanic eruptions
- Asteroid impact
- Anything that moves a large amount of water very rapidly

What kind of earthquakes generate tsunamis?
-------------------------------------------

- Very Large (> M7)
- Quakes that displace water
    - Thrust or normal faults
    - NOT strike-slip
- Quakes that trigger landslides

"Tsunami Earthquake"
--------------------

- Generates an anomalously large tsunami (given its magnitude)
- Mw significantly greater than Ms
- Very slow rupture
- Associated with slip within accretionary wedge (?)

How fast do tsunamis travel?
----------------------------

- Velocity dependent on water depth d
- v = âˆšgd
- Deep water: ~1000 kph
- Shallow water: ~30kph
- Wave slows, amplitude grows
