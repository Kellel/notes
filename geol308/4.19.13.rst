- S-waves bounce off of the outer core
- P-wave go through

- A p-wave propagation can create s-waves in the inner core 
- A wave hitting a boundry at an angle it creates forces in both the normal direction but also in the shear direction creating both p and s waves.

Nomenclature
------------

- P: P-wave in mantle
- S: S-wave in mantle
- K: P-wave in outer core
- C: Wave reflected off of outer core
- I: P-wave in inner core
- J: S-wave in inner core (converted from P)
- i: wave that has reflected within inner core
