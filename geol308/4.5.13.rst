What is an earthquake?
----------------------

An earthquake is the ground moving

Earthquakes are the result of stress being released

Stress = Force / Area

This mesurement is given by Newtons / Square Meters = Pa

Types of Strain / Stress
------------------------

If force is applied parallel to the surface normal it generates NORMAL STRESS

A force applied perpendicular to the surface normal generates SHEAR STRESS

Equal force in all directions generates PRESSURE

Change in shape is called STRAIN (deformation)

Normal strain = ε =ΔL/L(unitless)

Change in shape is called STRAIN

Shear Strain - angular deformation

Pressure - Changes volume "Dilatation" = ΔV/V

Stress { Normal, Shear, Pressure }

Strain = Deformation { Normal, Shear, Volumetric }
