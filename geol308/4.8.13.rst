Elastic moduli
--------------

Pysical properties that describe a material's resistance to deformation.

[Stress = elastric modulus X strain]

Normal Stress is shown by Î = EÎ

Î¼= shear modulus or rigidity modulus => resistance to shearing 

Pressure: P = K~TL/L 

Fluids have Î¼= 0

Frequency or f is given by cycles/sec also known as Hz

Earthquakes are generally between 0.001 Hz -> 50 Hz

Period (T) sec/cycle

Velocity (V) = Distance/Time for earthquakes we say V = Wavelength/Period or V = Wavelenght * Frequency
